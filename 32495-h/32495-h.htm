<h3>THE GREAT EXHIBITION, NOTES AND QUERIES, AND
CHAUCER'S PROPHETIC VIEW OF THE CRYSTAL PALACE.</h3>

  <p>The first of May, eighteen hundred and fifty-one, will be remembered
  in the Calendar for centuries after those who witnessed its glories shall
  have passed away. Its memory will endure with our language; and the
  Macaulays and Hallams of the time to come will add brilliancy to their
  pages by recounting the gorgeous yet touching ceremonial of this great
  Apotheosis of Peace. Peace has occasionally received some foretaste of
  that day's glory; but only at times, when the sense of its value had been
  purchased by the horrors which accompany even the most glorious warfare.
  But never until the reign of Victoria were its blessings thus recognised
  and thus celebrated, after they had been uninterruptedly enjoyed for
  upwards of a quarter of a century. Who then, among the thousands
  assembled around our Sovereign in that eventful scene, but felt his joy
  heightened by gratitude, that his lot had been cast in these happy
  days.</p>

  <p>It was a proud day for Queen Victoria, for her Illustrious Consort,
  for all who had had "art or part" in the great work so happily conceived,
  so admirably executed. And we would add (even at the risk of reminding
  our readers of Dennis' energetic claim, "That's my Thunder!") that it was
  also a proud day for all who, like ourselves, desire to promote
  intercommunication between men of the same pursuits,&mdash;to bring them
  together in a spirit, not of envious rivalry, but of generous
  emulation,&mdash;to make their powers, faculties, and genius subservient
  to the common welfare of mankind. In our humble way we have striven
  earnestly to perform our share in this great mission; and although in the
  Crystal Palace cottons may take the place of comments, steam-engines of
  Shakspeare, the palpable creations of the sculptor of the super-sensual
  imaginings of the poet, the real of the ideal,&mdash;still the <span
  class="scac">GREAT EXHIBITION OF THE INDUSTRY OF ALL NATIONS</span> is,
  in more senses than one, merely a <span class="scac">MONSTER NUMBER
  OF</span> "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>." So palpable,
  indeed, is this similarity, that, if the long-talked-of <i>Order of Civil
  Merit</i> should be instituted, (and certainly there was never a more
  fitting moment than the present for so honouring the cultivators of the
  peaceful arts), we make no doubt that "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>" will not be forgotten. Should our prophecy be fulfilled,
  we need scarcely remind our readers of Captain Cuttle's injunction and
  our Motto. <!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page362"></a>{362}</span></p>

  <p>And here, talking of prophecy, we would, first reminding our readers
  how, in the olden time, the Poet and the Prophet were looked upon as
  identical, call their attention to the following vision of our Queen in
  her Crystal Palace, which met the eye when in "fine phrensy rolling" of
  the Father of English Poetry, as he has recorded in his <i>House of
  Fame</i>. Had Chaucer attended the opening of the Exhibition as "<i>Our
  own Reporter</i>," could his description have been more exact?</p>

  <p>We are indebted for this interesting communication to our
  correspondent A.&nbsp;E.&nbsp;B., whose admirable <span class="sc">Illustrations of
  Chaucer</span> in our columns have given so much pleasure to the admirers
  of the old poet. Our correspondent has sent it to us in the hope that it
  may be made available in helping forward the good work of restoring
  Chaucer's tomb. We trust it will. The Committee who have undertaken that
  task could, doubtless, raise the hundred pounds required, by asking those
  who have already come forward to help them, to change their Crown
  subscriptions into Pounds. With a right feeling for what is due to the
  poet, they prefer, however, accomplishing the end they have in view by
  small contributions from the admiring many, rather than by larger
  contributions from the few. As we doubt not we number among the readers
  of "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" many admirers of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i2hg3">"Old Dan Chaucer, in whose gentle spright,</p>
      <p>The pure well-head of poetry did dwell,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>to them we appeal, that the monument which was erected by the
  affectionate respect of Nicholas Brigham, nearly three centuries ago, may
  not in our time be permitted to crumble into dust; reminding them, in
  Chaucer's own beautiful language,</p>

<h2>NOTES.</h2>

<h3>ON "THE LAY OF THE LAST MINSTREL."</h3>

  <p>I resume the subject commenced in the comments on "a Passage in
  <i>Marmion</i>," printed in No. 72., March 15, 1851; and I here propose
  to consider the groundwork and mechanism of the most original, though not
  quite the first production of Scott's muse, <i>The Lay of the Last
  Minstrel</i>. In the Introduction prefixed to this poem, nearly thirty
  years after its publication, Sir Walter Scott informs the world that the
  young Countess of Dalkeith, much interested and delighted with the wild
  Border tradition of the goblin called "Gilpin Horner" (which is given at
  length in the notes appended to the poem), enjoined on him the task of
  composing a ballad on the subject:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"And thus" (says Sir Walter) "the goblin story <i>objected to by
  several critics as an excrescence upon the poem</i>, was, in fact, the
  occasion of its being written."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Yes, and more than this; for, strange as it may appear to those who
  have not critically and minutely attempted to unravel the very artful and
  complicated plot of this singular poem, the Goblin Page is, as it were,
  the key-note to the whole composition, the agent through whose
  instrumentality the fortunes of the house of Branksome are built up anew
  by the pacification of ancient feud, and the union of the fair Margaret
  with Henry of Cranstoun. Yet, so deeply veiled is the plot, and so
  intricately contrived the machinery, that I question if this fact be
  apparent to one reader out of a thousand; and assuredly it has never been
  presented to my view by any one of the critics with whose comments I have
  become acquainted.</p>

  <p>The Aristarchus of the <i>Edinburgh Review</i>, Mr. Jeffrey, who
  forsooth thought fit to regard the new and original creations of a mighty
  and inventive genius "as a misapplication, in some degree, of very
  extraordinary talents," and "conceived it his duty to make one strong
  effort to bring back <i>the great apostle of this (literary) heresy to
  the wholesome creed of his instructor</i>," seems not to have penetrated
  one inch below the surface. In his opinion "the Goblin Page is the
  capital deformity of the poem," "<i>a perpetual burden</i> to the poet
  and to the readers," "an undignified and improbable fiction, which
  excites neither terror, admiration, nor astonishment, but needlessly
  debases the strain of the whole work, and excites at once our incredulity
  and contempt."</p>

  <p>Perhaps so, to the purblind vision of a pedantic formalist; but,
  nevertheless, <i>The Lay of the Last Minstrel</i>, that poem, whose
  varied imagery and vivid originality, combined with all its other
  beauties, have been, and ever will be, the delight and admiration of its
  readers, could not exist without this so-called "capital deformity." This
  I shall undertake to demonstrate, and in so doing to prove the "capital
  absurdity" of such criticism as I have cited.</p>

  <p>Let us therefore begin with the beginning. The widowed Lady of
  Branksome, brooding over the outrage which had deprived her husband of
  life, meditates only vengeance upon all the parties concerned in this
  affray. The lovely Lady Margaret wept in wild despair, for her lover had
  stood in arms against her father's clan:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And well she knew, her mother dread,</p>
      <p>Before Lord Cranstoun she should wed,</p>
      <p>Would see her on her dying bed."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The first Canto of the poem contains that singular episode,
  when&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"(The Ladye) sits in secret bower</p>
      <p>In old Lord David's western tower,</p>
      <p>And listens to a heavy sound</p>
      <p>That moans the mossy turrets round," &amp;c.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"From the sound of Teviot's tide</p>
      <p>Chafing with the mountain side,</p>
      <p class="i6">&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
      <p class="i1">The Ladye knew it well!</p>
      <p>It was the Spirit of the Flood that spoke,</p>
      <p class="i1">And he called on the Spirit of the Fell."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And when the River Spirit asks concerning the fair Margaret, who had
  mingled her tears with his stream:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"What shall be the maiden's fate?</p>
      <p>Who shall be the maiden's mate?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>the Mountain Spirit replies, that, amid the clouds and mist which veil
  the stars,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1hg3">"Ill may I read their high decree:</p>
      <p>But no kind influence deign they shower</p>
      <p>On Teviot's tide and Branksome's tower,</p>
      <p class="i1">Till <i>pride be quelled</i>, and <i>love be free</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I must here transcribe the following Section xviii.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The unearthly voices ceased,</p>
      <p class="i1">And the heavy sound was still;</p>
      <p>It died on the river's breast,</p>
      <p class="i1">It died on the side of the hill.</p>
      <p>But round Lord David's tower,</p>
      <p class="i1">The sound still floated near,</p>
      <p>For it rung in the Ladye's bower,</p>
      <p class="i1">And it rung in the Ladye's ear,</p>
      <p>She raised her stately head,</p>
      <p class="i1">And her heart throbbed high with pride:</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Your mountains shall bend,</p>
      <p>And your streams ascend,</p>
      <p class="i1">Ere Margaret be our foeman's bride!'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>In pursuance of this stern resolution, "the Ladye sought the lofty
  hall" where her retainers were assembled:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">

      <p>She called to her William of Deloraine."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>She then gives him the commission, well remembered by every reader, to
  proceed on that night to Melrose Abbey to unclose the grave of Michael
  <!-- Page 365 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page365"></a>{365}</span>Scott, and to rifle it of the magical
  volume which was accessible only on St. Michael's night, at the precise
  moment when the rays of the moon should throw the reflexion of the red
  cross emblazoned in the eastern oriel upon the wizard's monumental
  stone,&mdash;expecting that the possession of this "Book of Might" would
  enable her to direct the destiny of her daughter according to the
  dictates of her own imperious nature. "Dîs aliter visum." Fate and <span
  class="sc">Michael Scott</span> had willed it otherwise. And here I must
  beg my readers to take notice that this far-famed wizard, Michael Scott,
  although dead and buried, is supposed still to exert his influence from
  the world of spirits as the guardian genius of the house of Buccleuch;
  and he had been beforehand with the Ladye of Branksome in providing Henry
  of Cranstoun with one of his familiar spirits, in the shape of the Goblin
  Page, <i>by whose agency alone</i> (however unconscious the subordinate
  agent may be) a chain of events is linked together which results in the
  union of the two lovers. After this parenthesis I resume the thread of
  the narrative.</p>

  <p>Deloraine rides to Melrose in the night, presents himself to the Monk
  of St. Mary's aisle, opens the sepulchre of the wizard, and presumes to
  take</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"From the cold hand the Mighty Book,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>in spite of the <i>ominous frown</i> which darkened the countenance of
  the dead. He remounts his steed and wends his way homeward</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6hg3">"As the dawn of day</p>
      <p>Began to brighten Cheviot gray;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>while the aged monk, having performed the last duty allotted to him in
  his earthly pilgrimage, retired to his cell and breathed his last in
  prayer and penitence before the cross.</p>

  <p>Ere Deloraine could reach his journey's end, he encounters a feudal
  foeman in the person of Lord Cranstoun, attended by his Goblin Page, who
  is here first introduced to the reader. A conflict takes place, and
  Deloraine being struck down wounded and senseless, is left by his
  adversary to the charge of this elf, who in stripping off his corslet
  espied the "Mighty Book." With the curiosity of an imp he opens the
  iron-clasped volume by smearing the cover with the blood of the knight,
  and reads <span class="scac">ONE SPELL</span>, <i>and one alone, by
  permission</i>; for</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"He had not read another spell,</p>
      <p>When on his cheek a buffet fell,</p>
      <p>So fierce, it stretched him on the plain</p>
      <p>Beside the wounded Deloraine.</p>
      <p>From the ground he rose dismayed,</p>
      <p>And shook his huge and matted head;</p>
      <p>One word he muttered, and no more,</p>
      <p class="hg1">'Man of age, thou smitest sore!'</p>
      <p class="i6">&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
      <p>Now, if you ask who gave the stroke,</p>
      <p>I cannot tell, so mot I thrive&mdash;</p>
      <p><i>It was not given by man alive.</i>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>But he had read sufficient for the purposes of his mission, and we
  shall see how he applies the knowledge so marvellously acquired.</p>

  <p>By the glamour of this spell he was empowered to make one thing assume
  the form of another.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"It had much of glamour might,</p>
      <p>Could make a ladye seem a knight;</p>

      <p>Seem tapestry in a lordly hall,"</p>
      <p class="i6">&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The first use he makes of his power is to convey the wounded knight,
  laid across his weary horse, into Branksome Hall</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Before the beards of the warders all;</p>
      <p>And each did after swear and say,</p>
      <p>There only passed a wain of hay."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Having deposited him at the door of the Ladye's bower, he repasses the
  outer court, and finding the young chief at play, entices him into the
  woods under the guise <i>to him</i> of a "comrade gay."</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Though on the drawbridge, the warders stout,</p>
      <p>Saw a terrier and a lurcher passing out;"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and, leading him far away "o'er bank and fell," well nigh frightens
  the fair boy to death by resuming his own elvish shape.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Could he have had his pleasure wilde,</p>
      <p>He had crippled the joints of the noble child;</p>
      <p class="i6">&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
      <p>But his awful mother he had in dread,</p>
      <p><i>And also his power was limited</i>,"</p>
      <p class="i6">&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Here let me observe that all this contrivance is essential to the
  conduct of the narrative, and if we simply grant the postulate which a
  legendary minstrel has a right to demand, to wit, the potency of magic
  spells to effect such delusions (pictoribus atque Poetis <i>Quidlibet
  audendi</i> semper fuit æqua potestas), all the remainder of the
  narrative is easy, natural, and probable. This contrivance is necessary,
  because, in the first place, if it had been known to the warders that
  William of Deloraine had been brought into the castle wounded almost unto
  death, he could not be supposed capable of engaging Richard Musgrave in
  single combat two days afterwards; nor, in the second place, would the
  young chief have been permitted to stroll out unattended from the guarded
  precincts.</p>

  <p>To proceed: the boy thus bewildered in the forest falls into the lands
  of an English forayer, and is by him conveyed to Lord Dacre, at that time
  one of the Wardens of the Marches, by whom he is detained as a hostage,
  and carried along with the English troops, then advancing towards
  Branksome under the command of the Lord Wardens in person.</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"(But) though the child was led away,</p>
      <p>In Branksome still he seemed to stay,</p>
      <p>For so the Dwarf his part did play."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

<p><!-- Page 366 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page366"></a>{366}</span></p>

  <p>And there, according to his own malicious nature, played likewise a
  score of monkey tricks, all of which, grotesque and "<i>undignified</i>"!
  as they may be, yet most ingeniously divert the mind of the reader from
  the real errand and mission of this supernatural being.</p>

  <p>Shortly afterwards, on his exhibiting symptoms of cowardice at the
  expected contest, he is conveyed from the castle by the Ladye's order,
  and speedily rejoins his lord, after the infliction of a severe
  chastisement from the arm of Wat Tinlinn. He then procures Cranstoun's
  admission within the walls of Branksome (where the whole clan Scott was
  assembling at the tidings of the English Raid) by the same
  spell&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Which to his lord he did impart,</p>
      <p>And made him seem, by glamour art,</p>
      <p class="i1">A knight from hermitage."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And on the following day, as Deloraine did not appear in the lists
  ready to engage in the appointed duel with Richard Musgrave, we are
  told,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Meantime, full anxious was the Dame,</p>

      <p class="hg1">'Twixt Harden and 'twixt Thirtlestaine,</p>

      <p>But yet, not long the strife&mdash;for, lo!</p>
      <p>Himself the Knight of Deloraine,</p>
      <p>Strong, as it seemed, and free from pain,</p>
      <p class="i1">In armour sheathed from top to toe,</p>

      <p>And the fierce chiefs their claims withdrew."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The conflict takes place, and ends in favour of the Scottish knight;
  when the following scene occurs:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"As if exhausted in the fight,</p>
      <p>Or musing o'er the piteous sight,</p>

      <p>When lo! strange cries of wild surprise,</p>
      <p>Mingled with seeming terror rise</p>
      <p class="i1">Among the Scottish bands,</p>
      <p>And all, amid the thronged array,</p>
      <p>In panic haste gave open way</p>
      <p>To a half-naked ghastly man,</p>
      <p>Who downward from the castle ran;</p>
      <p>He crossed the barriers at a bound,</p>
      <p class="i1">And wild and haggard looked around,</p>
      <p class="i2">As dizzy, and in pain;</p>
      <p class="i1">And all, upon the armed ground</p>
      <p class="i2">Knew William of <span class="correction" title="Original reads `Delorane'.">Deloraine</span>!</p>

      <p>And to the Ladye led her son."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Then is described the struggle that takes place in the maternal
  breast:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And how the clan united prayed</p>
      <p class="i1">The Ladye would the feud forego,</p>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i6"><span class="scac">XXVI.</span></p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The mission of the elf is now accomplished, his last special service
  having been to steal the armour of William of Deloraine "while slept the
  knight," and thus to enable his master to personate that warrior.</p>

  <p>It may be remarked that hitherto there is no direct evidence that the
  Page was sent by Michael Scott. That evidence is reserved for the moment
  of his final disappearance.</p>

  <p>On the same evening, after the celebration of the nuptials, a
  mysterious and intense blackness enveloped the assembled company in
  Branksome Hall.</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p>Full through the guests' bedazzled band</p>

      <p>As on the elvish Page it broke,</p>

      <p class="i1">And on the spot where burst the brand,</p>
      <p class="i2">Just where the Page had flung him down,</p>
      <p class="i1">Some saw an arm, and some a hand,</p>
      <p class="i2">And some the waving of a gown:</p>
      <p>The guests in silence prayed and shook,</p>
      <p>And terror dimmed each lofty look,</p>
      <p>But none of all the astonished train</p>
      <p><i>Was so dismayed as Deloraine,</i></p>

      <p><span class="sc">It was the wizard, Michael Scott.</span>"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>After this final consummation, it is amusing to notice a slight
  "incuria" on the part of the poet, which I wonder has never been
  corrected in the later editions. Having described the nuptial ceremony of
  Cranstoun and Margaret in the early part of the last Canto, he says in
  Section xxviii.,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Nought of the bridal <i>will</i> I tell,</p>
      <p>Which <i>after</i> in short space befell,"</p>
      <p class="i6">&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I think I have now succeeded in proving that the Goblin Page, so far
  from being a mere "<i>intruder</i>" into this glorious poem&mdash;so far
  from being a mere after-thought, or interpolation, to "suit the taste of
  the cottagers of the Border," as Mr. Jeffrey "suspects,"&mdash;is the
  essential instrument for constructing the machinery of the plot. We have,
  indeed, the author's word that it formed the foundation of the poem. My
  readers will therefore form their own estimate of the value of Mr.
  Jeffrey's criticisms, couched as they are in no very considerate, much
  less complimentary phraseology. I cannot but admire the "douce vengeance"
  of the gentle-spirited subject of his rebukes, who has contented himself
  with printing these worthless sentences of an undiscerning critic along
  with the text of his poems in the last edition,&mdash;there to remain a
  standing memorial of the wisdom of that resolution adhered to throughout
  the life of the accomplished author, who tells us,</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"That he from the first determined, that without shutting his ears to
  the voice of true criticism, he would pay no regard to that which assumed
  the form of satire."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In point of fact, Sir Walter had no very exalted opinion of the
  <i>genus</i> Critic; and I could give one or two anecdotes, which I heard
  from his own lips, strongly reminding one of the old fable of the painter
  who pleased nobody and everybody.</p>

  <p>In conclusion, I beg leave to observe, that in these "Notes" I do not
  presume to underrate, in any degree, Mr. Jeffrey's acknowledged powers of
  criticism. He and Scott have alike passed away from the stage of which
  they were long the ornaments in their respective spheres; but I must
  consider that in the passages here cited, <i>as well as in many
  others</i>, he has proved himself either incompetent or unwilling to
  appreciate the originality, the power, and, above all, the invention of
  Sir Walter Scott's genius.</p>

<h3>POEMS DISCOVERED AMONG THE PAPERS OF SIR
KENELM DIGBY.</h3>

  <p>Since I last wrote to you on the subject of these poems, I have
  discovered the remaining portions of Ben Jonson's poem on the Lady
  Venetia: I have therefore no doubt now that my MS. is a genuine
  autograph; and if so, not only this, but the "Houreglasse," which was
  inserted in your 63rd No., is Ben Jonson's. This last has, I think, never
  been published; nor have I ever seen in print the followings lines, which
  are written in the same hand and on the same paper as the "Houreglasse."
  They were probably written after Lady Venetia's death.</p>

  attempted cure of consumption, or some <!-- Page 368 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page368"></a>{368}</span>complaints, by walking
  among a flock of sheep, is not new. The present Archbishop of Dublin was
  recommended it, or practised it at least, when young. For pulmonary
  complaints the principle was perhaps the same as that of following a
  plough, sleeping in a room over a cowhouse, breathing the diluted smoke
  of a limekiln, that is, the inhaling of carbonic acid, all practised
  about the end of the last century, when the knowledge of the gases was
  the favourite branch of chemistry.</p>

  <p>A friend of mine formerly met Dr. Beddoes riding up Park Street in
  Bristol almost concealed by a vast bladder tied to his horse's mouth. He
  said he was trying an experiment with oxygen on a broken-winded horse.
  Afterwards, finding that oxygen did not answer, he very wisely tried the
  gas most opposite to it in nature.</p>

  <p><i>Sacramental Wine</i> (Vol. iii., p. 320.).&mdash;This idea is a
  relic of Roman Catholic times. In Ireland a weakly child is frequently
  brought to the altar rails, and the priest officiating at mass requested
  to allow it to drink from the chalice of what is termed <i>the
  ablution</i>, that is, the wine and water with which the chalice is
  <i>rinsed</i> after the priest has taken the communion, and which
  ablution ordinarily is taken by the priest. <i>Here</i> the efficacy is
  ascribed to the cup having just before contained the blood of Our Lord. I
  have heard it seriously recommended in a case of hooping-cough. Your
  correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Buckman</span> does not give
  sufficient credit for common sense to the believers in some portion of
  folk lore. Red wine is considered tonic, and justly, as it contains a
  greater proportion of <i>turmic</i> than white. The yellow bark of the
  barberry contains an essential tonic ingredient, as the Jesuit's bark
  does <i>quinine</i>, or that of the willow <i>salicine</i>. Nettle juice
  is well known as a purifier of the blood; and the navelwort, like
  Euphrosia, which is properly called <i>Eyebright</i>, is as likely to
  have had its name from its proved efficacy as a simple, as from any
  fancied likeness to the region affected. The old monks were shrewd
  herbalists. They were generally the physicians of their neighbourhood,
  and the names and uses of the simples used by them survive the ruin of
  the monasteries and the expulsion of their tenants.</p>

<h3>METROPOLITAN IMPROVEMENTS.</h3>

  <p>The following passage from a sermon preached at Paul's Cross, March
  26, 1620, by John King, Bishop of London, refers in a curious manner to
  many improvements and alterations which have either been already effected
  in our own time, or are still in contemplation. The sermon was "on
  behalfe of Paule's Church," then in a ruinous condition; and was
  delivered in the presence of James himself, who suggested the preacher's
  text, Psal. cii. 13, 14.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"So had my manner ever beene aforetime," says the Bishop, "to open the
  volume of this Booke, and goe through the fields of the Old and New
  Testament, plucking and rubbing such eares of corne therein as I best
  liked, makings, choice (I meane) of my text, and buckling myself to my
  task at myne owne discretion; but now I am girt and tied to a Scripture
  by him, who as he hath most right to command, so best skill to direct and
  appoint the best service I can."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>After an elaborate laudation of England, and of London as the "gem and
  eye," which has</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"the body of the King, the morning and midday influence of that
  glorious sun; other parts having but the evening.... <i>O fortunati
  nimium</i>; you have the finest flowre of the wheat, and purest bloud of
  the grape, that is, the choice of His blessed Word hath God given unto
  you; and great is the companie of the preachers"&mdash;</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>the Bishop proceeds thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Not to weary mine eyes with wandering and roving after private, but
  to fixe upon publicke alone,&mdash;when I behold that forrest of masts
  upon your river for trafficke, and that more than miraculous bridge,
  which is the <i>communis terminus</i>, to joyne the two bankes of that
  river; your Royall Exchange for merchants, your Halls for Companies, your
  gates for defence, your markets for victuall, your aqueducts for water,
  your granaries for provision, your Hospitalls for the poore, your
  Bridewells for the idle, your Chamber for orphans, and your Churches for
  holy assemblies; I cannot denie them to be magnificent workes, and your
  Citty to deserve the name of an Augustious and majesticall Citty; to cast
  into the reckoning those of later edition, the beautifying of your fields
  without, and pitching your Smithfield within, new gates, new waterworkes,
  and the like, which have been consecrated by you to the dayes of his
  Majestie's happy reigne: and I hope the cleansing of the River, which is
  the <i>vena porta</i> to your Citty, will follow in good time. But after
  all these, as Christ to the young man in the Gospell, which had done all
  and more, <i>Unum tibi deest, si vis perfectus esse, vade, vende</i>; so
  may I say to you. There is yet one thing wanting unto you, if you will be
  perfit,&mdash;perfit this church: not by parting from <i>all</i>, but
  somewhat, not to the poore, but to God himselfe. This Church is your Sion
  indeed, other are but <i>Synagogues</i>, this your <i>Jerusalem the
  mother to them all</i>, other but daughters brought up at her knees; this
  the Cathedrall, other but Parochiall Churches; this the <i>Bethel</i> for
  the daily and constant service of God, other have their intermissions,
  this the common to you all, and to this <i>doe <!-- Page 369 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page369"></a>{369}</span>your tribes ascend</i>
  in their greatest solemnities; others appropriated to several
  Congregations, this the standart in the high rode of gaze; others are
  more retired, this the mirrour and marke of strangers, other have but
  their side lookes; finally, this unto you, as <i>S. Peters in the
  Vatican</i> at Rome, <i>S. Marks</i> at Venice, and that of <i>Diana</i>
  at Ephesus, and this at Jerusalem of the Jewes; or if there be any other
  of glory and fame in the Christian world, which they most joy in."</p>

  <p><i>Spenser's Faerie Queene.</i>&mdash;The following brief notes may
  perhaps prove interesting:&mdash;</p>

  <p>1. Spenser gives us a hint of the annoyances to which Shakspeare and
  Burbage may have been subject:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"All suddenly they heard a troublous noise,</p>
      <p class="i1">That seemed some perilous tumult to design,</p>
      <p>Confused with women's cries and shorts of boys,</p>
      <p>Such as the troubled theatres oft-times annoys."&mdash;B. IV. iii. 37.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>2. Spenser's solitary pun occurs in book iv. canto viii. verse
  31.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"But when the world wox old, it wox <i>war-old</i>,</p>
      <p>Whereof it hight."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>3. Cleanliness does not appear to have been a virtue much in vogue in
  the "glorious days of good Queen Bess." Spenser (book iv. canto xi. verse
  47.) speaks of</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Her silver feet, fair washed against this day,"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p><i>i. e.</i> for a special day of rejoicing.</p>

  <p>4. An instance of the compound epithets so much used by Chapman in his

  <p><i>A small Instance of Warren Hastings' Magnanimity.</i>&mdash;During
  the latter years of his life, Warren Hastings was in the habit of
  visiting General D'Oyley in the New Forest; and thus he became <!-- Page
  370 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page370"></a>{370}</span>acquainted
  with the Rev. W. Gilpin, vicar of Boldre, and author of <i>Forest
  Scenery</i>, &amp;c. Mr. Gilpin's custom was to receive morning visitors,
  who sat and enjoyed his agreeable conversation; and Warren Hastings, when
  staying in the neighbourhood, often resorted to the Boldre Parsonage. It
  happened, one Sunday, that Mr. Gilpin preached a sermon on the character
  of Felix, which commenced in words like these:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Felix was a bad man, and a bad governor. He took away another man's
  wife and lived with her; and he behaved with extortion and cruelty in the
  province over which he ruled."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Other particulars followed equally in accordance with the popular
  charges against the late Governor-General of India, who, to the
  preacher's dismay, was unexpectedly discovered sitting in the D'Oyley
  pew. Mr. Gilpin concluded that he then saw the last of his "great"
  friend. But, not so: on the following morning Warren Hastings came, with
  his usual pleasant manner, for a chat with the vicar, and of course made
  no allusion to the sermon.</p>

  <p>This was told me by a late valued friend, who was a nephew and curate
  of Mr. Gilpin; and I am not aware that the anecdote has been put on
  record.</p>

  <p><i>Registry of Dissenting Baptisms in Churches.</i>&mdash;A fact came
  to my knowledge some time since, which seems worthy of having <i>a note
  of it</i> made, and recorded in your journal. On looking over the
  registry of baptisms administered in the meeting-house of an ancient
  city, I was struck by the occurrence of four names, which I had seen
  entered in a genealogy as from the baptismal registry of one of its
  parish churches. This appeared to me so strange, that I examined the
  parish registry in order to verify it; and I found that the baptisms were
  actually recorded as on the same days in both registries. Of course, the
  father, having had his child baptized by the dissenting minister,
  prevailed on the clergyman of his parish church to register it.</p>

  <p>Whether this was a common custom at the time when it took place
  (1715-21) I have no means of knowing. As a fee was probably charged for
  the registration, it was not likely to be asked for in all instances;
  and, no doubt, when it was asked for, many clergymen would consider it
  inconsistent with their duty to grant it.</p>

<h3>NOTES AND QUERIES RELATING TO SCANDINAVIA.</h3>

  <p>Can any of your readers furnish a list of the different editions of
  <i>Olaus Magnus</i>? I have lately met with a curious one entitled
  <i>Historia delle Gente et della Natura delle Cose Settentrionali, da
  Olao Magno Gotho Arcivescovo di Vpsala nel Regno di Suezia e Gozia,
  descritta in XXII Libri. Tradotta in Lingua Toscana. In Vinegia,
  1565.</i> This edition, in folio, contains a very interesting old map of
  Scandinavia, and a profusion of little cuts or engravings, representing
  men, animals, gods, mountains, weapons, religious rites, natural wonders,
  and everything relating to the people and the country that could be
  conceived or gathered together. Is there any English translation of Olaus
  Magnus?</p>

  <p>Is there any English translation of Jornandes' <i>Histoire Générale
  des Goths</i>? It is full of curious matter. The French edition of 1603
  gives the following accounts of the midnight sun:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Diverses nations ne laissent pas d'habiter ces contrées" (Scanzia or
  Scandinavia). "Ptolomée en nomme sept principales. Celle qui s'appelle
  Adogit, et qui est la plus reculée vers le Nord, voit (dit on) durant
  l'Esté le Soleil rouler l'horizon quarante jours sans se coucher; mais
  aussi pendant l'Hyver, elle est privée de sa lumière un pareil espace de
  temps, payant ainsi par le long ennui que lui cause l'absence de cet
  Astre, la joye que sa longue présence lui avoit fait ressentir."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>There is a little old book called <i>Histoire des Intrigues Galantes
  de la Reine Christine de Suède et de sa Cour, pendant son sejour à Rome.

<blockquote class="b1n">

</blockquote>

  <p>and after giving various accounts, personal and incidental, of her
  mercurial majesty, and of her pilgrimage to Rome, recites the following
  epigram on her first intrigue there, which, to give due precedence to the
  church, happened to be with a Cardinal, named Azolin:&mdash; <!-- Page

<h3>THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH.</h3>

  <p>Query, Has Mons. Foucault's pendulum experiment been as yet clearly
  enunciated? and do I understand it aright, when I conceive it is intended
  to show the existence of a certain uniform <i>rotation in azimuth of the
  horizon</i>, but different for different latitudes; which rotation, if
  made out to exist, is acquired solely in virtue of the uniform diurnal
  rotation (15° hourly) in right ascension of the equator, identical in all
  latitudes.</p>

  <p>A pendulum, manifestly, can only be suspended vertically, and can only
  vibrate in a vertical plane; and surely can only be conceived, in the
  course of the experiment, to be referred to the <i>horizon</i>, that
  great circle of the heavenly sphere to which all vertical circles are
  referred.</p>

  <p>A spectator at the north pole has the pole of the heavens coincident
  with his zenith; and there, all declination circles are also vertical
  circles; and there, the equator coincides with the horizon; whereby the
  whole effect of the rotation of the earth there (15° hourly) may be
  conceived to be given to the <i>horizon</i>: whilst, at the equator, the
  horizon is perpendicular to the equator, which therefore gives no such
  rotation at all to the horizon. Simple inspection of a celestial globe
  will illustrate this. Considering the matter thus, at the pole the
  rotation of the <i>horizon</i> is 15° hourly, and at the equator is 0, or
  nothing. But the sine of the latitude (=90°) at the pole is unity, or 1;
  and the sine of the latitude (=0°) at the equator is 0. Therefore, at
  these two extremes, the expression 15° × sin. lat. actually does give the
  amount of <i>hourly apparent rotation of the horizon</i>; namely, 15° at
  one place, and 0° at the other. Now, as I understand the experiment, as
  given in the public prints, it is asserted that the same expression of
  15° × sin. lat. will give the <i>rotation of the horizon</i> in
  intermediate latitudes; of which rotation I subjoin a table calculated
  for the purpose.</p>

  <p>Now this is the point which, it should seem, ought to be the business
  of experimenters to establish; it being proposed, as we are informed, to
  swing, in different latitudes, freely suspended pendulums, over
  horizontal dials, or circular tables, properly graduated, similarly to
  the horizons of common globes; and to note the <i>apparent</i> variation
  of the plane of oscillation of the pendulums with respect to the
  graduated dials; these latter serving as representatives of the horizon.
  For the hypothesis is (as I understand it), that the pendulums will
  continue to swing each of them severally in one invariable vertical plane
  fixed in free space, whilst the horizontal dials beneath, by their
  rotation, will slip away, as it were, and turn round in <i>azimuth</i>,
  from under the planes of the pendulums.</p>

  <p>It should seem to be imperative on those who wish to put this
  experiment to proof, to give all possible attention to the precautions
  suggested in the excellent paper that appeared on the subject, on
  Saturday, April 19, in the <i>Literary Gazette</i>, copied also into the
  <i>Morning Post</i> of Monday the 21st. To my mind, the experiment is
  beset with practical difficulties; but even should the matter <!-- Page
  372 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page372"></a>{372}</span>be
  satisfactorily made out to those best capable of judging, I cannot
  readily conceive of an experiment less likely than the above to carry
  conviction to the minds of the wholly unlearned of the rotation of the
  earth.</p>

  <p>I perceive that B.A.C., in the <i>Times</i> of April 24, avows his
  determined scepticism as to the virtue of the experiment.</p>

  These <i>Capitulations</i> (to prevent mistakes) were simply the

  Swiss regiments had their special "capitulations" until 1830, when they
  ceased to be employed in France. They appear to have differed in almost
  every regiment of the Irish brigade; the privileges of some being greater
  than those of others. One was common to all, namely, the right of
  <i>trial</i> by their officers or comrades solely, and according to the
  laws of their own country.</p>

  <p>Also, is there any history of the brigades published? I have heard
  that a Colonel Dromgoole published one. Can any information be afforded

  intended merely to convey a general idea of the sumptuousness and
  splendour of their style of living?</p>

  dead Saviour, usually called in Italy a <i>Pietà</i>. St. B. is said to
  have been the founder of the charitable institutions still called in
  France <i>Monts-de-Piété</i>, originally for the purpose of lending to
  the poor small sums on trifling pledges&mdash;what we should now call a

  <p><i>Sabbatical and Jubilee Years of the Jews.</i>&mdash;As the solution
  of many interesting topics in connexion with Jewish history is yet
  dependent on the <i>period</i> of the institution of the Sabbatical and
  Jubilee years, the following observations will not perhaps be deemed
  unworthy of a "nook" in your columns. A spark may blaze! I therefore
  throw it out to be fanned into a more brilliant light by those of your
  readers whose studies peculiarly fit them to inquire more searchingly
  into the subject. The Jews, it has been remarked by various writers, were
  ignorant of <i>astronomy</i>. Both, however, the Sabbatical and Jubilee
  years have been, as I conceive and will endeavour to show, founded on
  astronomical observation, commemorative of no particular event in Jewish
  history, but simply that of the moon's revolutions; for instance, with
  reference to the <i>Sabbatical</i> year, allowing for a difference of
  four days and a half, which occurs <i>annually</i> in the time of the
  moon's position on the equator, it would require, in order to realise a
  number corresponding to the days (29) employed by the moon in her
  synodical revolution round the earth, a period to elapse of little less
  than six years and a half: thus exhibiting the Jews' <i>seventh</i> or
  <i>Sabbatical year</i>, or year of rest. This result, besides being
  instructive and commemorative of the moon's menstrual course, is at the
  same time indicative, as each Sabbatical year rolls past, of the approach
  of the "<i>finisher of the Seven Sabbaths of years</i>," or year of
  Jubilee, so designated from its being to the chosen people of God, under
  the Jewish dispensation, a year of "freedom and redemption," in
  commemoration of the moon's <i>complete</i> revolution, viz., her return
  to a certain position at the precise time at which she set out therefrom,
  an event which takes place but once in <i>fifty years</i>: in other
  words, if the moon be on the equator, say, on the first day of February,
  and calculating twenty-nine days to the month, or twelve lunations to the
  year, a cycle of fifty years, or "seven Sabbaths of years," must elapse
  ere she will again be in that position on the same day.</p>

<h3>HISTOIRE DES SÉVARAMBES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., pp. 4. 72. 147.)</p>

  <p>The History of the Sevarites, in the original English edition,
  consists of two parts: the first published in 1675, in 114 pages, small
  12mo., without a preface; the second published in 1679, in 140 pages,
  with a preface of six pages. The French version of this work is much
  altered and enlarged. The title is changed into <i>Histoire des
  Sévarambes</i>, the "Sevarites" being dropped. There is a preface of
  fifteen pages, containing a supposed letter from Thomas Skinner, dated
  Bruges, Oct. 28, 1672. The work is divided into five parts, three of
  which are in the first, and two in the second volume of the Amsterdam
  edition of 1716. These five parts are together more than twice as bulky
  as the two parts of the English work. There is no copy of the original
  French edition of 1677-9 described by Marchand, in any English public
  library; but if there is a copy in the French national library, any of
  your bibliographical correspondents at Paris could easily ascertain
  whether (as is probably the case) the Amsterdam edition is a mere reprint
  from the original Paris edition.</p>

  <p>The French version of this work is not only much enlarged, but it
  differs in the names and incidents, and is fuller in the account of the
  institutions and customs of the imaginary state. The English edition of
  1738 (1 vol. 8vo.) is a literal translation from the French version,
  though it does not purport to be a translation. It may be doubted whether
  the translator was aware of the existence of the English publication of
  1675-9. The German translation was published in 1680; the Dutch
  translation in 1682: both these appear to have been taken from the
  French.</p>

  <p>Morhof (<i>Polyhistor.</i>, vol. i. p. 74.), who inserts this work
  among the <i>libri damnati</i>, and dwells upon its deistical character,
  refers to the French version; and though he knew that the book had
  originally appeared in English, he probably was not aware of the
  difference between the two versions. A note added by his first editor,
  Moller, states that Morhof often told his friends that he believed Isaac
  Vossius to have been the author of the work. Isaac Vossius was in England
  from 1670 until his death, which took place at Windsor, February 21,
  1689. His residence in England, combined with the known laxity of his
  religious opinions, doubtless suggested to Morhof the conjecture that he
  wrote this freethinking Utopia. There is, however, no external evidence
  to support this conjecture, or to show that it had any better foundation
  than the conjecture that Bishop Berkeley wrote <i>Gaudentio di Lucca</i>.
  The University of Leyden purchased the library of Isaac Vossius for
  36,000 florins. If it is still preserved at Leyden, a search among his
  books might ascertain whether there is among them any copy of the English
  or French editions of this work, and whether they contain any written
  remark by their former possessor. Moreover, it is to be observed that the
  system of natural religion is for the first time developed in the French
  edition; and this was the part which chiefly gave the book its celebrity:
  whereas, the supposition of Morhof implies that the English and French
  versions are identical.</p>

  <p>Heumann, in his <i>Schediasma de Libris Anonymis et Pseudonymis</i>
  (Jena, 1711), p. 161. (reprinted in Mylius, <i>Bibliotheca Anon. et
  Pseudon.</i>, Hamburg, 1740, vol. i. pp. 170-6.) has an article on the
  <i>Histoire des Sévarambes</i>. It is there stated that "Messieurs de
  Portroyal" superintended the French translation of the work; but no
  authority is given for the statement. Christian Thomasius, <!-- Page 375
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page375"></a>{375}</span>in his
  <i>Monthly Review</i> of November 1689, attributed the work to D'Allais
  (or Vairasse). He alleged three reasons for this belief: 1. The rumour
  current in France; 2. The fact that Allais sold the book, as well as his
  French grammar; 3. That a comparison of the two works, in respect of
  style and character of mind, renders it most probable that both are by
  the same author. The testimony of Thomasius is important, as the date of
  its publication is only ten years posterior to the publication of the
  last part of the French version.</p>

  <p>Leclerc, in a review of the <i>Schediasma</i> of Heumann, in the
  <i>Bibliothèque Choisie</i>, published in 1712 (tom. xxv. p. 402., with
  an addendum, tom. xxvi. p. 460.), attests positively that Vairasse was
  the author of the work in question. He says that Vairasse (or, as he
  spells the name, Veiras) took the name of D'Allais in order to sell his
  book. He had this fact from persons well acquainted with Vairasse. He
  likewise mentions that Vairasse was well known to Locke, who gave Leclerc
  an account of his birthplace. Leclerc adds that he was acquainted with a
  person to whom Vairasse wished to dedicate his book (viz. the <i>Histoire
  des Sévarambes</i>), <i>and who possessed a copy of it, with a species of
  dedication, written in his hand</i>.</p>

  <p>This testimony is so distinct and circumstantial, as to leave no
  reasonable doubt as to the connexion of Vairasse with the French version.
  The difficulty as to the authorship of the English version still,
  however, remains considerable. The extensive alterations introduced in
  the French edition certainly render it probable that <i>two</i> different
  writers were concerned in the work. The words of Leclerc respecting the
  information received from Locke are somewhat ambiguous; but they do not
  necessarily imply that Locke knew anything as to the connexion of
  Vairasse with the book, though they are not inconsistent with this
  meaning. Locke had doubtless become acquainted with Vairasse during his
  residence in England. Considering the length of time which Vairasse
  passed in England, and the eminence of the persons with whom he is said
  to have had relations (viz. the Duke of York, Lord Clarendon, and Locke),
  it is singular that no mention of him should be discoverable in any
  English book.</p>

  <p>The error, that the work in question was written by Algernon Sidney,
  appears to have arisen from a confusion with the name of Captain Siden,
  the imaginary traveller. Fabricius (<i>Bibliograph. Antiq.</i>, c. xiv.
  §16. p. 491.) mentions Sidney and Vairasse as the two most probable
  claimants to the authorship.</p>

  <p>Hume, in his <i>Essay on Polygamy and Divorces</i>, refers to the
  <i>History of the Sevarambians</i>, and calls it an "agreeable
  romance."</p>

<h3>WAS THERE AN "OUTER TEMPLE" IN THE POSSESSION
OF THE KNIGHTS TEMPLARS OR KNIGHTS
OF ST. JOHN?&mdash;(Vol. iii., p. 325.)</h3>

  <p>I have great pleasure in complying with the very proper request of
  <span class="sc">Mr. Foss</span>, and give my authority at once for
  stating in the <i>Hand-book for London</i> that the so-called "Outer
  Temple" was a part of the Fleet Street possession of the Knights Templars
  or Knights of St. John, or was in any manner comprehended within the New
  Temple property of Fleet Street and Temple Bar. My authority is Sir
  George Buc, whose minute and valuable account of the universities of
  England is dedicated to Sir Edward Coke. Buc's words are
  these:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"After this suppression and condemnation of the Templers, their house
  here in Fleete Street came to the handes and occupation of diuers Lordes.
  For our Antiquaries and Chronologers say, that after this suppression Sir
  Thomas Plantagenet Earl of Lancaster (and Cousin to the King then
  raigning) had it, but beeing after attainted of treason, hee enjoyed it
  but a short time.</p>

  <p>"Then next Hugh Spencer Earle of Glocester got into it, but he also
  was soone after attainted, and executed for Treason. After him Andomare
  de Valence, a nobleman of the great house of Lusignan, and Earle of
  Pembrooke, was lodged in it for a while. But this house was '<i>Equus
  Seianus</i>' to them all: and (as here it appeareth) was ordayned by God
  for other better uses, and whereunto now it serueth. After all these
  noble tenants and occupants were thus exturbed, dead, and gone, then
  certaine of the reuerend, ancient professours of the Lawes, in the raign
  of King Edward the Third, obtained a very large or (as I might say) a
  perpetuall Lease of this Temple, or (as it must bee understood) of two
  parts thereof distinguished by the names of the Middle Temple and the
  Inner Temple, from the foresayd Ioannites.... But the other third part,
  called the Outward Temple, Doctor Stapleton, Bishop of Exceter, had
  gotten in the raign of the former King, Edward the Second, and conuerted
  it to a house for him and his successors, Bishops of Exceter ... of whom
  the late Earle of Essex purchased it, and it is now called Essex house:
  hauing first beene (as I haue sayd) a part of the Templers' house, and in
  regard of the scituation thereof, without the Barre, was called the
  Outward or Utter Temple, as the others, for the like causes, were called
  the Middle Temple and the Inner Temple."&mdash;Sir George Buc, in
  <i>Stow</i> by Howes, ed. 1631, p. 1068.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This seems decisive, if Buc is to be relied on, as I think he is. But
  new facts, such as <span class="sc">Mr. Foss's</span> researches and
  <span class="sc">Mr. Burtt's</span> diligence are likely to bring to
  light, may upset Buc's statement altogether.</p>

  <p>I must join <span class="sc">Mr. Foss</span> in his wish to ascertain
  <i>when</i> the names Inner Temple and Middle Temple were first made use
  of, with a further Query, which I should be glad to have settled,
  <i>when</i> the See of Exeter first obtained the site of the so-called
  <!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum"><a

<h3>OBEISM.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 59.)</p>

  <p>In reply to F. H., I beg leave to state that Obeism is not in itself a
  religion, except in the sense in which Burke says that "superstition is
  the religion of feeble minds." It is a belief, real or pretended, in the
  efficacy of certain spells and incantations, and is to the uneducated
  negro what sorcery was to our unenlightened forefathers. This
  superstition is known in St. Lucia by the name of <i>Kembois</i>. It is
  still extensively practised in the West Indies, but there is no reason to
  suppose that it is rapidly gaining ground. F.&nbsp;H. will find ample
  information on the subject in Père Labat's <i>Nouveau Voyage aux Isles
  françaises de l'Amérique</i>, tome ii. p. 59., and tome iv. pp. 447. 499.
  and 506., edition of 1742; in Bryan Edwards' <i>History of the West
  Indies</i>, vol. ii. ch. iii., 5th edition (London, 1819); and in Dr.
  R.&nbsp;R. Madden's <i>Residence in the West Indies</i>, vol. ii. letter 27.
  Perhaps the following particulars from Bryan Edwards (who says he is
  indebted for them to a Mr. Long) on the etymology of <i>obeah</i>, may be
  acceptable to some of your readers:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The term <i>obeah</i>, <i>obiah</i>, or <i>obia</i>, (for it is
  variously written,) we conceive to be the adjective, and <i>obe</i> or
  <i>obi</i>, the noun substantive; and that by the word
  <i>obia</i>&mdash;men or women&mdash;is meant those who practise
  <i>obi</i>. The origin of the term we should consider as of no
  importance, in our answer to the question proposed, if, in search of it,
  we were not led to disquisitions that are highly gratifying to curiosity.
  From the learned Mr. Bryant's commentary upon the word <i>oph</i>, we
  obtain a very probable etymology of the term. 'A serpent, in the Egyptian
  language, was called <i>ob</i> or <i>aub</i>.' '<i>Obion</i> is still the
  Egyptian name for a serpent.' 'Moses, in the name of God, forbids the
  Israelites ever to inquire of the demon <i>Ob</i>, which is translated in
  our Bible, charmer or wizard, divinator aut sorcilegus.' 'The woman at
  Endor is called <i>oub</i> or <i>ob</i>, translated Pythonissa; and
  <i>oubaois</i> (he cites from <i>Horus Apollo</i>) was the name of the
  Basilisk or Royal Serpent, emblem of the sun, and an ancient oracular
  deity of Africa.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>One of your correspondents has formed a substantive from <i>obe</i> by
  the addition of <i>ism</i>, and another from <i>obeah</i> by the same
  process; but it will be seen by the above quotation that there is no
  necessity for that obtrusive termination, the superstitious practice in
  question being already sufficiently described by the word <i>obe</i> or
  <i>obi</i>.</p>

<h3>SAN MARINO.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 321.)</p>

  <p>On the death of Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta, without legitimate male
  issue, in October, 1468, Pope Paul II. declared Rimini and his other
  fiefs to have reverted to the Holy See. In the spring of the following
  year the Pontiff proceeded, with the assistance of the Venetians, to
  enforce his claim, and threatened the Republicans of San Marino with his
  vengeance if they did not aid him and his allies in gaining possession of
  Rimini, which Roberto Malatesta, one of the illegitimate sons of
  Sigismondo Pandolfo, had seized by stratagem.</p>

  <p>By advice of their faithful friend Federigo, Count of Urbino, who was
  at the head of the opposite league, comprising the King of Naples, the
  Duke of Milan, and the Florentines, the San-Marinese forwarded the Papal
  mandate to Florence, and requested through their ambassador, one Ser
  Bartolomeo, the support of that Republic. Several letters appear to have
  been sent in answer to their applications, and the one communicated by
  <span class="sc">Mr. Sydney Smirke</span> is characterised by Melchiarre
  Delfico (<i>Memorie storiche della Repubblica di San Marino.</i>
  Capolago, 1842, 8vo. p. 229.) as</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Del tutto didattica e parenetica intorno alla libertà, di cui i
  Fiorentini facevano gran vanto, mentre erano quasi alla vigilia di
  perderla intieramente."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>San Marino was not attacked during the campaign, which terminated on
  the 30th of August of the same year (1469) with the battle of Vergiano,
  in which Alessandro Sforza, the commander of the Papal forces, was
  signally defeated by Federigo.</p>

  <p>San Marino has never, so far as I have been able to ascertain,
  undergone the calamity of a siege, and its inhabitants have
  uninterruptedly enjoyed the blessing of self-government from the
  foundation of the Republic in the third or fourth century to the present
  time, with the exception of the few months of 1503, during which the
  infamous Cesare Borgia forced them to accept a Podestà of his own
  nomination. Various causes have contributed to this lengthened
  independence; but it may be stated that, in the fifteenth and sixteenth
  centuries, the San Marinese owed it no less to their own patriotism,
  courage, prudence, and good faith, than to the disinterested protection
  of the Counts and Dukes of Urbino, whose history has been so ably written
  by Mr. Dennistoun, in his recently published memoirs of that chivalrous
  race.</p>

  <p>The privileges of the Republic were confirmed on the 12th of February,
  1797, by Napoleon Buonaparte, who offered to enlarge its
  territory,&mdash;a boon which its citizens were wise enough to decline;
  thinking, perhaps, with Montesquieu, that&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Il est de la nature d'une république qu'elle n'ait qu'un petit
  territoire: sans cela, elle ne peut guère subsister."&mdash;<i>Esprit des

<h3>THE BELLMAN AND HIS HISTORY.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 324.)</p>

  <p>The Bellman's songs may be found in the <i>Bellman's Treasury,
  containing above a Hundred several Verses, fitted for all Humours and
  Fancies, and suited to all Times and Seasons</i>. London: 8vo. 1707.
  Extracts from this book are given in Hone's <i>Every Day Book</i>, vol.
  ii. p. 1594.</p>

  <p>I have now before me a broadside thus entitled: "A copy of verses,
  humbly presented to the Right Worshipful the Mayor, Aldermen, and Common
  Councilmen, and the rest of my worthy Masters and Mistresses, dwelling in
  Cambridge. By Thomas Adams, Bellman, 1810." There is a large engraving,
  from a wood-block, apparently a century old, representing a bellman, in a
  flowing wig and a three-cornered hat, holding, in his right hand a bell,
  and in his left a javelin and lantern; his dog is behind him.</p>

  <p>The verses are:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>&nbsp; 1. Prologue.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; 2. To the Right Worshipful the Mayor.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; 3. To the Aldermen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; 4. To the Common Councilmen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; 5. To the Town Clerk.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; 6. To the Members for the Town.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; 7. On the King.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; 8. On the Queen.</p>
      <p>&nbsp; 9. On Christmas Day.</p>
      <p>10. On New Year's Day.</p>
      <p>11. To the Young Men.</p>
      <p>12. To the Young Maids.</p>
      <p>13. On Charity.</p>
      <p>14. On Religion.</p>
      <p>15. Epilogue.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>This is marked as the 24th sheet; that is, as I suppose, the 24th set
  of verses presented by Mr. Adams.</p>

  <p>I have also a similar broadside, "by Isaac Moule, jun., bellman,
  1824," being "No. III." of Mr. Moule's performances. The woodcut is of a
  more modern character than Mr. Adams's, and delineates a bellman in a
  three-cornered hat, modern coat, breeches, and stockings, a bell in his
  right hand, and a small dog by his side. The bellman is represented as
  standing in front of the old Shire Hall in Cambridge, having Hobson's
  Conduit on his right.</p>

  <p>The subjects of Mr. Moule's verses are similar to those of Mr. Adams,
  with the following variations. He omits verses to the Town Clerk, the
  Members for the Town, the Queen, on Charity, and on Religion, and inserts
  verses "On St. Crispin," and "To my Masters and Mistresses."</p>

  <p>The office of bellman in this town was abolished in 1836, and to the
  bellman's verses have succeeded similar effusions from the lamplighters,
  who distribute copies when soliciting Christmas boxes from the
  inhabitants.</p>

  heretical sentiments. His executor having brought in this will to be
  proved two years after Tracy's death (in 1532), "the Convocation most
  cruelly judged that he should be taken out of the ground, and burnt as an
  heretick," which was accordingly done; but the chancellor of the diocese

  <p><i>The Vellum-bound Junius</i> (Vol. iii., pp. 262. 307.).&mdash;In

  relative to the "Vellum-bound copy of Junius;" also a reference to the
  subject in a prior number of the "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>." Not being in England, and not having the prior numbers,
  it is not possible to make myself acquainted with the subject contained
  in that reference, but I will endeavour to throw some light on the Query
  in the Number which has been forwarded to me. The writer of the
  <i>Letters of Junius</i> was the secretary of the first Marquis of
  Lansdowne, better known as Lord Shelburne. From his Lordship he obtained
  all the political information necessary for his compositions. The late
  Marquis of Lansdowne possessed the copy bound in vellum (two volumes),
  with many notes on the margin in Lord Shelburne's handwriting; they were
  kept locked up in a beautiful ebony casket bound and ornamented with
  brass. That casket has disappeared, at least so I have been told, and not
  many years ago inquiry was made for it by the present head of that house.
  Maclean was a dark, strong-featured man, who wore his hat slouched over
  his eyes, and generally a large cloak. He often corrected the slips or
  proofs of his letters at Cox's, a well-known printer near Lincoln's Inn,
  who deemed himself bound in honour never to divulge what he knew of that
  publication, and was agitated when once suddenly spoken to on the subject
  near the door of the small room in which the proofs were corrected, and
  with a high and honourable feeling requested never to be again spoken to
  on the subject. The late President of the Royal Academy, Benjamin West,
  knew Maclean; and his son, the late Raphael West, told the writer of
  these remarks, that when a young man he had seen him in the evening at
  his father's in Newman Street, and once heard him repeat a passage in one
  of the letters which was not then published. A more correct and veracious
  man than Mr. R. West could not be. Maclean stammered, and was
  consequently of no use to Lord Shelburne as a debater and supporter in
  parliament. A place in the East Indies was obtained for him, and he
  sailed in the Aurora frigate for that dependency, and was lost in her at
  the same time with Falconer, the author of the poem entitled <i>The
  Shipwreck</i>. The able tract published by Mr. Pickering, Piccadilly,
  would constitute a fair foundation on which to build the inquiry.</p>

  S.&nbsp;T.&nbsp;D. to ascertain "how the author of the <i>Pursuits of

  <p><i>Dutch Books</i> (Vol. iii., p. 326.).&mdash;<span
  class="sc">Martinus</span> is probably aware that the library of the
  Fagel family is now a part of the University Library of Dublin, and that
  it contains a very fine collection of Dutch literature, in which it is
  very possible some of the books of which he is in search may be
  found.</p>

  <p>The auction catalogue prepared in 1800, when the library was to have
  been sold by auction, had it not been purchased by the University of
  Dublin, is printed, and a copy of it is at his service, if he will inform
  me through you how to send it to him.</p>

  <p>This library contains many rare tracts and documents well worthy of
  Mr. Macaulay's attention, if he is about to continue his history of the
  Revolution; but I have not heard whether he has made any inquiry after
  them, or whether he is aware of their existence. There is a curious MS.
  catalogue of them in the possession of the University, which was too
  voluminous to be printed, when the library was about to be sold.</p>

  <p><i>Engilbert, Archbishop of Treves</i> (Vol. i., p 214.).&mdash;There
  can be no doubt that the bishop's reference is incorrect, and the
  suggestion of T.&nbsp;J. (Vol. iii., p. 291.) to consult the reprint of 1840
  affords no aid in setting it right; for there we find (p. 178.) a note as
  follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"There was no Engilbert, Archbishop of Treves, nor is there any work
  in this name in Goldasti."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I have, however, consulted Mr. Bowden's <i>Life and Pontificate of
  Gregory VII.</i>, in order, if possible, to find a clue; and in a note in
  vol. ii. p. 246. of that work is a statement of the hesitation of the
  Pope on the doctrine of the eucharist, with a reference as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Vid. <i>Egilberti</i> archiep. Trevir. epist. adv. Greg. VII., in
  Eccardi Corp. historic. Medii Ævi. t. ii. p. 170."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>This reference I have verified, and found in the epistle of Egilbertus
  the passage which, no doubt, Bishop Cosin refers to, and which Mr. Bowden
  cites:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"En verus pontifex et sacerdos, qui dubitat si illud quod sumatur in
  dominicâ mensâ sit verum corpus et sanguis Christi!"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So much for that part of the difficulty, but another still remains.
  Was there ever an Egilbertus, or Engilbertus, Archbishop of Treves? To
  solve this question I consulted a list of the Archbishops of Treves in
  the <i>Bibliothèque Sacrée</i> of Richard et Giraud, and I there find the
  following statement:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Engelbert</i>, grand-prévôt de Passau, fut intrus par la faveur de
  l'empereur Henri IV., et sacré par des évêques schismatiques. Il mourut
  en 1101."</p>

  <p><i>Charles Lamb's Epitaph</i> (Vol. iii., p. 322.).&mdash;According to
  Mr. Thorne (<i>Rambles by Rivers</i>, 1st series, p. 190.) the
  inscription in the churchyard at Edmonton, to the memory of Charles Lamb,
  was written "by his friend, Dr. Carey, the translator of 'Dante.'" Mr.
  Thorne gives an anecdote concerning this inscription which I venture to
  transcribe, in the expectation that it may interest your correspondent
  <span class="sc">Maria S.</span>, and others of your numerous
  readers.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We heard a piece of criticism on this inscription that Lamb would
  have enjoyed. As we were copying it, a couple of canal excavators came
  across the churchyard, and read it over with great deliberation; when
  they had finished, one of them said, 'A very fair bit of poetry that;'
  'Yes,' replied his companion, 'I'm blest if it isn't as good a bit as any
  in the churchyard; rather too long, though.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>By "Dr. Carey," of course, is meant the Rev. Henry Francis Cary, M.A.,
  Vicar of Bromley Abbots, Staffordshire, and Assistant Librarian in the
  British Museum, as he was the translator of "Dante," and an intimate
  friend of Charles Lamb.</p>

  <p><i>Charles II. in Wales</i> (Vol. iii., p. 263.).&mdash;In answer to
  <span class="sc">Davydd Gam's</span> Query, it may be observed that I
  have never heard of the tradition in question, nor have I met with any
  evidence to show that Charles II. was in any part of Wales at this
  period. In "The true Narrative and Relation of his most sacred Majesty's
  Escape from Worcester," <i>Selection from the Harleian Miscellany</i>,
  4to., p. 380., it is stated that the king meditated the scheme of
  crossing into Wales from White Ladies, the house of the Penderells, but
  that "the design was crossed." One of the "Boscobel Tracts," at p. 137.,
  treating of the same period, and compiled by the king himself in 1680,
  mentions his <!-- Page 380 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page380"></a>{380}</span>intention of making his escape another
  way, which was to get over the Severn into Wales, and so get either to
  Swansea, or some other of the sea towns that he knew had commerce with
  France; beside that he "remembered several honest gentlemen" that were of
  his acquaintance. However, the scheme was abandoned, and the king fled to
  the southward by Madeley, Boscobel, &amp;c., to Cirencester, Bristol, and
  into Dorsetshire, and thence to Brighton, where he embarked for France on
  the 15th Oct., 1651.</p>

  <p>Lancaiach is still in possession of the Prichard family, descendants
  of Col. Prichard.</p>

  <p>There is a tradition that Charles I. slept there on his way from
  Cardiff Castle to Brecon, in 1645, and the tester of the bed in which his
  Majesty slept is stated to have been in the possession of a Cardiff
  antiquary now deceased. The facts of the case appear in the <i>Iter
  Carolinum</i>, printed by Peck (<i>Desiderata Curiosa</i>). The king
  stayed at Cardiff from the 29th July to the 5th August, 1645, on which
  day he dined at Llancaiach, and supped at Brecon.</p>

  <p>The origin of this phrase is connected with the following
  story:&mdash;A certain Greek (whose name has for the present escaped me,
  but who must have been ready to contribute to the "<span class="sc">Notes
  and Queries</span>" of his time) was one day observed carefully
  "stepping" over the <span title="aulos" class="grk"
  >&alpha;&#x1F50;&lambda;&#x1F79;&sigmaf;</span> or footrace-course at
  Olympia; and he gave as a reason for so doing, that when that race-course
  was originally marked out, it was exactly six hundred times as long as
  Hercules' foot (that being the distance Hercules could run without taking
  breath): so that by ascertaining how many times the length of his own
  foot is contained, he would know how much Hercules' foot exceeded his
  foot in length, and might therefrom calculate how much Hercules' stature
  exceeded that of ordinary men of those degenerate days.</p>

  <p>This proverb does not appear to be of classical origin. Several

  <p><i>Bucaneers</i> (Vol. i., p. 400.).&mdash;Your correspondent C. will
  find an interesting account of the Bucaneers in a poem by M. Poirié St.
  Aurèle, entitled <i>Le Flibustier</i>, and published by Ambroise Dupont
  &amp; Co., Paris, 1827. The Introduction and Notes furnish some curious
  particulars relative to the origin, progress, and dissolution of those
  once celebrated pirates, and to the daring exploits of their principal
  leaders, Montauban, Grammont, Monbars, Vand-Horn, Laurent de Graff, and
  Sir H. Morgan. The book contains many facts which go far to support Bryan
  Edwards's favourable opinion. I may add that the author derives the
  French word <i>flibustier</i> from the English <i>freebooter</i>, and the
  English word <i>bucaneer</i> from the French <i>boucanier</i>; which
  latter word is derived from <i>boucan</i>, an expression used by the
  Caribs to describe the place where they assembled to make a repast of
  their enemies taken in war.</p>

  <i>German</i>. In Germany <i>Gottes-acker</i> is a name for churchyard;
  and it is to be found in Wachter's <i>Glossarium Germanicum</i>, as well

  <p><i>God's Acre.</i>&mdash;The term <i>God's Acre</i>, as applied to a

  the resting-place of His faithful departed, sown with immortal seed (1
  Cor. xv. 38.), which shall be raised in glory at the great harvest (Matt.
  xiii. 39.; Rev. xiv. 15.). The church-yard is "dedicated wholly and only
  for Christian burial," and "the bishop and ordinary of the diocese, as
  <i>God's minister, in God's stead accepts it</i> as a freewill offering,
  to be severed from all former profane and common uses, to be held as holy
  ground," and "to be <i>God's storehouse</i> for the bodies of His saints
  there to be interred." See "Bishop Andrewes' Form of Consecration of a
  Churchyard," <i>Minor Works</i>, pp. 328-333., Oxf., 1846.</p>

  <p><i>Francis Moore and his Almanack</i> (Vol. iii., p. 263.).&mdash;Mr.
  Knight, in his <i>London</i>, vol. iii. p. 246., throws a little light on

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The renowned Francis Moore seems to have made his first appearance
  about the end of the seventeenth century. He published a <i>Kalendarium
  Ecclesiasticum</i> in 1699, and his earliest <i>Vox Stellarum</i> or
  <i>Almanac</i>, as far as we can discover, came out in 1701," &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>But Mr. Knight is not sure that "Francis Moore" was not a <i>nom de
  guerre</i>, although at p. 241. he gives the portrait of the "Physician"
  from an anonymous print, published in 1657.</p>

  <p class="author">A. A.</p>

  <p class="address">Abridge.</p>

  <p>There is an Irish edition published in Drogheda, sold for threepence,
  and <i>embellished</i> with a portrait of Francis Moore. Can Ireland
  claim this worthy? Many farmers and others rely much on the weather
  prophecies of this almanack. A tenant of mine always announces to me
  triumphantly that "Moore is right:" but his triumphs come at very long
  intervals.</p>

  <p class="author">K.</p>

  <p>I can answer part of H. P. W.'s Query. Francis Moore's celebrated
  <i>Almanack</i> first appeared in 1698. We have this date upon his own
  confession. Before his <i>Almanack</i> for 1771 is a letter which begins
  thus:</p>

  <p>That such a personage really did exist there can be little doubt,
  Bromley (in <i>Engraved Portraits, &amp;c.</i>) gives 1657 as the date of
  his birth, and says that there was a portrait of him by Drapentier <i>ad
  vivum</i>. Lysons mentions him as one of the remarkable men who, at
  different periods, resided at Lambeth, and says that his house was in
  Calcott's Alley, High Street, then called Back Lane, where he seems to
  have enlightened his generation in the threefold capacity of astrologer,
  physician, and schoolmaster.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p>Professor De Morgan has just furnished a new contribution to <i>L' Art
  de vérifier les Dates</i>, in the shape of a small but most useful and
  practical book, entitled <i>The Book of Almanacks, with an Index of
  Reference, by which the Almanack may be found for every year, whether in
  the Old Style or New, from any Epoch Ancient or Modern up to</i> <span
  class="scac">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 2000. <i>With means of finding the Day of any
  New or Full Moon from</i> <span class="scac">B.&nbsp;C.</span> 2000 <i>to</i>
  <span class="scac">A.&nbsp;D.</span> 2000. An example will show, better even
  than this ample title-page, the great utility of this work to the
  historical enquirer. Walter Scott, speaking of the battle of Bannockburn,
  which was fought on the day of St. John the Baptist, June 24, 1314,
  says,</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"It was a night of lovely June,</p>
      <p>High rose in cloudless blue the moon."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Now, should the reader be desirous of testing the accuracy of this
  statement, (and how many statements have ere this been tested by the fact
  of the moon's age!), he turns to Professor De Morgan's Index, which at
  1314 gives Epact 3., Dominical Letter F., Number of Almanack 17. Turning
  to this almanack, he finds that the 24th June was on a Monday; from the
  Introduction (p. xiii.) and a very easy calculation, he learns that the
  full moon of June, 1314, would be on the 27th, or within a day, and from
  a more exact method (at p. xiv.), that the full moon was within two hours
  of nine A.M., on the 28th. So that Sir Walter was correct, there being
  more than half moon on the night of which he was speaking. Such an
  instance as the one cited will show how valuable the <i>Book of
  Almanacks</i> must prove to all historical students, and what a ready
  test it furnishes as to accuracy of dates, &amp;c. It must take its place
  on every shelf beside Sir H. Nicolas' <i>Chronology of History</i>.</p>

  <p>We doubt not that many of our readers share our feeling as to the
  importance of children's books, from the influence they may be destined
  to exercise upon generations yet unborn. To all such we shall be doing
  acceptable service by pointing out Mrs. Alfred Gatty's little volume,
  <i>The Fairy Godmothers and other Tales</i>, as one which combines the
  two essentials of good books for children; namely, imagination to
  attract, and sound morals to instruct. Both these requisites will be
  found in Mrs. Gatty's most pleasing collection of tales, which do not
  require the very clever frontispiece by Miss Barker to render the volume
  an acceptable gift to all "good little Masters and Mistresses." <!-- Page

  <p>Messrs. Sotheby and Wilkinson (3. Wellington Street, Strand) will

  Letters, Historical Documents, and original MSS. of distinguished
  writers, as that of <i>Kenilworth</i> in the Autograph of Sir W. Scott,
  of <i>Madoc</i> in that of Southey, unpublished poems by Burns, and <i>Le
  Second Manuscrit venu de St. Hélène</i>. One of the most curious Lots is
  No. 1035, Shakspeare's play of <i>Henry IV.</i>, two parts condensed into
  one,&mdash;a contemporary and unique Manuscript, being the only one known
  to exist of any of the productions by the Sweet Bard of Avon. It is
  presumed to be a playhouse copy with corrections in the Autograph of Sir
  Edward Deering of Surrenden, in Kent, (who died in 1644); and, as no
  printed copy is known to contain the various corrections and alterations
  therein, is supposed to have been so corrected for the purposes of
  private representation, it being well known that theatricals formed a
  portion of the amusements in vogue at that baronet's country seat during
  the early portion of the reign of James I. Our readers will remember that
  the Shakspeare Society showed their sense of its value by printing it
  under the editorship of Mr. Halliwell.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">The Tomb of Geoffrey Chaucer in Westminster
  Abbey</span> stands in need of repair. The portrait and the inscriptions
  have disappeared; the overhanging canopy has suffered damage; the table
  is chipped and broken; the base is fast mouldering into irretrievable
  decay.</p>

  <p>Such an announcement is calculated to stir every heart that can
  respond to the claims of poetry, or feel grateful for the delight which
  it affords to every cultivated mind. It summons us, like the sound of a
  trumpet, "To the rescue!" It cannot be that the first and almost the
  greatest of English bards should ever be allowed to want a fitting
  memorial in our "Poet's Corner," or that the monument which was erected
  by the affectionate respect of Nicholas Brigham, nearly three centuries
  ago, should, in our time, be permitted to crumble into dust.</p>

  <p>A sum under One Hundred Pounds will effect a perfect repair.</p>

  <p>It is thought that there can be no difficulty in raising such a sum,
  and that multitudes of people in various conditions of life, and even in
  distant quarters of the globe, who venerate the name of Chaucer, and have
  derived instruction and delight from his works, will be anxious to
  contribute their mite to the good deed.</p>

  <p>The Committee have therefore not thought it right to fix any limit to
  the subscription; they themselves, with the aid of several distinguished
  noblemen and gentlemen, have opened the list with a contribution from
  each of them of Five Shillings, but they will be ready to receive any
  amount, more or less, which those who value poetry and honour Chaucer may
  be kind enough to remit to them.</p>

  <p>The design of the Committee is sanctioned by the approval of the Earl
  of Carlisle, the Earl of Ellesmere, the Earl of Shaftesbury, Lord
  Braybrooke. Lord Londesborough, Lord Mahon, the Right Hon. C.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;W. Wynn,
  and by the concurrence of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster.</p>

  <p>An account of the sums received and expended will be published when
  the work is completed.</p>

  <p>Subscriptions are received by all the members of the Committee, and at
  the Union Bank, Pall Mall East. Post-office orders may be made payable to
  William Richard Drake, Esq., the Treasurer, 46. Parliament Street, at the
  Charing Cross Office.</p>
